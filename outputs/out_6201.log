this is the command that we need to run quickly:
time echo $THISMONTH | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | cut -c1-2 | rev
lets try it in isolation to confirm it runs quickly by default

pretty quick
the theory is that too many calls to the above command
slows its performance
lets test this by firing up nodes one at a time that
will continually call the above command
in between calls, the script will move a small number of
files between directories and then do the same thing again
progress should slow as more nodes are called in
lets start
calling in node 0
