This is the command that we need to run quickly:
time echo $THISMONTH | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | cut -c1-2 | rev; sleep 0.3
lets try it in isolation to confirm it runs quickly by default

Pretty quick.
The theory is that too many calls to the above command
slows its performance.
However, if the nodes must move a lot of files in between
these commands, it slows the calls to the command above,
and no slowdown is seen.
We will test this below.
The above call will be made but many files will be moved
between directories between calls to the above command.
We dont expect to see a slowdown with this script.
