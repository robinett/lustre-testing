this is the command that we need to run quickly:
time echo $THISMONTH | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | cut -c1-2 | rev; sleep 0.3

pretty quick
now lets start moving files to see if this slows performance
we are going to fire up a new node every 10 seconds.
each node will be charged with continually copying, moving,

this simulates what happens in post-processing
we will only time how long it takes to run the echo/rev/cut command
lets start
