this is the command that we need to run quickly:
time echo $THISMONTH | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | cut -c1-2 | rev; sleep 0.3
lets try it in isolation to confirm it runs quickly by default

pretty quick
now lets start moving files to see if this slows performance
we are going to fire up 10 nodes.
each node will be charged with continually copying, moving,
and then deleting files.
this simulates what happens in post-processing
we will only time how long it takes to run the echo/rev/cut command
lets start

lets continue to check in every 10 seconds to follow how it
further degrades
stop when you feel like it; this will continue indefinetely
generally, performance degrades after 5 minutes
