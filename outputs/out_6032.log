this is the command that we need to run quickly:
time echo $THISMONTH | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | cut -c1-2 | rev; sleep 0.3
lets try it in isolation to confirm it runs quickly by default


real	0m0.035s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.014s
pretty quick
now lets start moving files to see if this slows performance
we are going to fire up 10 nodes.
each node will be charged with continually copying, moving,
and then deleting files.
this simulates what happens in post-processing
we will only time how long it takes to run the echo/rev/cut command
lets start
